Spenser is a web application built with Nuxt and TypeScript, designed to help users manage their personal transactions efficiently. The platform offers various features including transaction management, category creation, budget specification, and more, all through an intuitive user interface.

## Live Demo

- **Budget Specification:** Set budgets for specific categories and time periods.

### Settings

- **Global Settings:** Configure display currency and other global settings.

### Admin Features

- **User Management:** Admins can perform CRUD operations on user accounts.
- **Currency Management:** Add more currencies to the platform.
- **AI Configuration:** Choose between different AI providers (ChatGPT, Ollama, or OpenRouter).

## Installation
### Background tasks for AI Import

Long-running AI imports run in background using an in-memory task manager:

- Start via `POST /api/ai-import/parse` â†’ returns `{ success, taskId }`.
- List user tasks: `GET /api/tasks`.
- Cancel: `POST /api/tasks/:id/cancel`.
- Retrieve parsed result: `GET /api/tasks/ai-import/:id/result`.

Tasks are not persisted to the DB and expire ~4h after inactivity.
